# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Orange Button Core. It's people like you that make Orange Button Core such a great libarary.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Orange Button Core is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you!  There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Orange Button itself.

Orange Button Core is intended to be soruce code that can be consumed by application programs, other orange button libraries, etc...   It is not intended to be an end to end system.  Generally speaking if a particular library component could not be used in at least two client scenarios it does not belong in Orange Button Core.  Furthermore source code in Orange Button Core must:

* Follow the design goals stated in the Core documentation
* Be fully commented
* Contain comprehensive test coverage including but not limited to cross platform (Windows, Linux, and Mac) testing.
* Subject to vulnerability scan
* Will be peer reviewed

If source code does not meet all of the above criteria please place it in a different Orange Button repository.  It is fine to start code elsewhere and add it to the Core repository at a future date.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities

* Follow the notes in the overview.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.  Being a library programmed in Python the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/) is followed.
