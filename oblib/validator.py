# TODO: There are several main improvements at this point in time:
#
#  1) Currently Python types (int, bool, str) are supported for values.
#     However there is a second case where the inputs are always strings.
#     For instance the string "37" would be valid for xbrli:integerItemType
#     while "Arf" would not be.
#  2) There is a much larger number of  basic xbrli types that should be
#     included beyond boolean, string, and integer.
#  3) XBRL types that are derived from the basic types should also be
#     implemented.  This will require the entire Taxonomy class (not just
#     the stripped down Taxonomy class shipped in the ZIP file).
#  4) In all likelihood end users will wish to receive more information on
#     what caused the error condition as opposed to simply receiving False.
#     This may require a different function signature.
