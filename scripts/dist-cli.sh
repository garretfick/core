# TODO: Usage of ../solar-taxonomy works on the first run of the compiled
# cli but does not clean up at the end of the run.  Subsequent runs 
# produce warnings but still function.  In order to correct the behavior
# remove .. from the path.  This will require coding changes to find the
# correct placement of solar-taxonomy.
